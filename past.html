                <h3>General Computing Experience</h3>
                    <p> During the years leading up to Year 12, I had been learning a few coding languages (such as <span style="color:#00d9ff">Python, HTML and Java</span>) as I had enjoyed developing different softwares and websites. This had greatly assisted in the subjects IST (Information and Software Technology) and SDD (Software Design and Development) where we used HTML and Python for our final projects. </p>

                <h3>School Computing Experience</h3>
                    <p> I completed the HSC and graduated in 2021 from Macquarie Fields High School. During my schooling years, I studied both <span style="color:#00d9ff">IST (Information and Software Technology)</span> in Year 9-10 and <span style="color:#00d9ff">SDD (Software Design and Development)</span> in Year 11-12. These subjects gave me a greater general understanding surrounding the IT field. Additionally during Year 6, I volunteered to be apart of the technology team where I learned how computers function to frequently assist in the maintenance of school computers.  </p>
