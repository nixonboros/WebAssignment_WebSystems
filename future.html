                    <p> In the future, I would like to work in the <span style="color:#00d9ff">Enterprise Systems Developement</span> or the <span style="color:#00d9ff">Interaction Design</span> field. Thus, I will be majoring in both Enterprise Systems Developement and Interaction Design in the upcoming years as I enjoy both creating software applications and designing/creating technologies which support interactivity. Although, at the moment I am unsure on deciding on one specific field between the two. </p>

                    <p> I am also interested in learning how computers function more in depthly as currently I only have general knowledge and am curious as computers have always had a detrimental impact on humans everyday lives whether it would be from productivity to entertainment. Maybe in the future, I might undergo additional study to learn Computer Science.</p>
